# autoalign_dynamo
Script for...
- Automated fiducial detection and recentering based on 2D average of bead across tilt series using Dynamo
- Creation of an IMOD model from these bead positions for use with the IMOD program tiltalign

Things this script doesn't do...
- Generate tomograms tomograms (in my workflow I create deconvolved tomograms at the same time as binned tomogram reconstruction in Warp)
- Generate aligned stacks
